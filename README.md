Hi,

I have been progressively programming more and more since 2016 starting out with just
some basic HTML/JS/CSS and now I'm a professional programmer. I'm always on the lookout for exciting
opportunities although often I require some persuading to switch jobs.

Now I'm a TS nerd that's thrown around into a lot of different tasks such as .Net, SQL, DevOps or other misc. backend technologies. I think it's the result of 
being able to read documentation but there are other factors that play into it. I heard somebody
on the internet say that a few hours of trial and error can save whole minutes of reading docs.

With that small joke I'll leave you.
