Hi,

I have been progressively programming more and more since 2016 starting out with just
some basic HTML/JS/CSS and now I'm a professional programmer. I'm always on the lookout for exciting
opportunities although often I require some persuading to switch jobs.

Now I'm a TS nerd that's thrown around into a lot of different tasks. I think it's the result of 
being able to read documentation but there are other factors that play into it. I heard somebody
on the internet say that a few hours of trial and error can save whole minutes of reading docs.

With that small joke I'll leave you. Visit olafur.net if you're interested in my outdated portfolio
page, otherwise feel free to contact me in case of some questions.

Thanks for visiting.\n
